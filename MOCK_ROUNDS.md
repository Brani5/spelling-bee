## 🎬 BONUS: "The Influencer Round"

Otto pretends he's a YouTube star teaching kids to spell. For each word, he must:
1. Say the word
2. Explain the PATTERN ("OK so this word has a silent K...")
3. Spell it
4. Use it in his OWN sentence

**Words for Influencer Round:**

1. **creeper** — "It's got a vowel team — double E — so it says EEEE"
2. **knight** — "The K and GH are SILENT, bro. You don't say them!"
3. **phone** — "PH makes an F sound. Weird, right?"
4. **whale** — "WH at the start, and Magic E at the end!"
5. **village** — "G is being sneaky — it sounds like J!"
6. **scratch** — "SCR is a triple blend, and TCH at the end!"
7. **survive** — "Bossy R in the middle, Magic E at the end!"
8. **mountain** — "OU makes that OW sound, like... OW!"
9. **enchant** — "CH digraph right in the middle!"
10. **challenge** — "CH at the start, soft G at the end. Double trouble!"

## After Each Round — Review

1. Look at the ❌ words
2. What PATTERN were they? (Not which word — which PATTERN)
3. If Otto missed 3 Bossy R words → practice that pattern, not those specific words
4. Tomorrow's practice = focus on weak patterns

---

*Pro tip: If Otto nails Round 3 with 20+ points, he's ready. Tell him: "You know the system. Whatever word they give you — listen, find the pattern, spell it. You've got this."*
