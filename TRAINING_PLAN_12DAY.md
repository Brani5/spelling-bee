# 🏔️ Otto's Spelling Bee Training Plan
## 12 Days to Victory | Feb 28 — Mar 11, 2026 | Competition: Mar 12

**Otto Karel, 7, Grade 2, OpenGate Praha**

---

## ⚡ Ground Rules

- **Max 10 minutes per session** (8 is fine, 12 is too many)
- **One session per day** (on ski trip: after skiing, warm & relaxed)
- **If Otto says "I don't want to"** → skip that day. One skipped day is fine. Don't force it.
- **If Otto is tired/cranky** → just do 2-3 review words and stop. That counts!
- **Always end on a WIN** → finish with a word he already knows

## 🎿 Phase 1: SKI TRIP (Days 1-6) — "The Basics"
*Light sessions, no pressure. Build the system, not the word count.*

### Day 1 (Feb 28) — "Sound Detective" 🔍
**Goal:** Introduce the idea that words have PATTERNS (not random letters)
- Explain: "Words aren't random — they follow rules. Today we learn to hear them."
- **Category:** Short Vowels (words 1-10)
- Do 5 words together, then Otto does 3 alone
- **Game:** "I spy a short A sound" — say words, Otto claps when he hears it
- **End with:** Let Otto spell his name: O-T-T-O. "See? You already know how!"

### Day 2 (Mar 1) — "The Digraph Duo" 🤝
**Goal:** CH, SH, TH, WH — two letters, one sound
- Review: 3 random words from yesterday (quick!)
- **Category:** Consonant Digraphs (words 26-35)
- **Game:** "Digraph or not?" — say words, Otto says if there's a digraph
- **Minecraft hook:** "CHEST — what digraph? CH! SHIELD — what digraph? SH!"
- **End with:** Otto picks his favorite word of the day

### Day 3 (Mar 2) — "Blend Master" 💪
**Goal:** Blends — you hear BOTH letters
- Review: 2 digraphs, 2 short vowels
- **Category:** Consonant Blends (words 51-60)
- **Key difference:** Digraph = 1 sound (SH), Blend = 2 sounds (S+K in SKIP)
- **Game:** "Speed round" — Otto spells 5 easy words, timed. Beat your own record!
- **Ski connection:** "SNOW — S+N blend! SLED — S+L blend!"

### Day 4 (Mar 3) — "Bossy R" 😤
**Goal:** R-controlled vowels change everything
- Review: mix of 4 words from days 1-3
- **Category:** R-Controlled Vowels (words 76-85)
- **Explain:** "R is bossy. When R stands next to a vowel, the vowel changes its sound."
- **Game:** "Bossy R detector" — say words, Otto identifies the bossy R pattern
- **End with:** "STAR — you're a STAR, Otto!" (he spells it)

### Day 5 (Mar 4) — "Magic E" ✨
**Goal:** Silent E makes the vowel say its name
- Review: 4 random from previous days
- **Category:** Silent E (words 146-155)
- **Demo:** Write CAN → CANE. "See? E jumped on and A changed!"
- **Game:** "Add the Magic E" — say CVC words, Otto adds E and says new word
  - cap → cape, kit → kite, hop → hope, cub → cube, pin → pine
- **Roblox hook:** "GAME — that's Magic E! Without E it would be GAM. Weird."

### Day 6 (Mar 5) — "Mix & Review" 🎲
**Goal:** Can Otto identify the PATTERN in any word?
- NO new words today
- **Game: "What's the Pattern?"**
  - Say 15 words from all categories so far
  - Otto says: "short vowel" / "digraph" / "blend" / "bossy R" / "magic E"
  - No spelling needed — just HEARING the pattern
- **Reward:** If he gets 10+/15 → he picks tomorrow's activity (within reason 😄)

## 🏠 Phase 2: HOME (Days 7-10) — "Level Up"
*Harder words, mixed patterns, more independence*

### Day 7 (Mar 6) — "Vowel Teams" 🎤
**Goal:** AI, AY, EE, EA, OA, OO — when vowels team up
- Quick review: 5 random pattern-identification (no spelling, just name the pattern)
- **Category:** Vowel Teams (words 101-110)
- **Rule:** "When two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking"
- **Game:** "Vowel Team or Magic E?" — Otto sorts words into two groups
- **YouTube hook:** "PLAY — that's AY vowel team! You PLAY Roblox, right?"

### Day 8 (Mar 7) — "The Tricky Ones" 🕵️
**Goal:** Diphthongs + endings
- Review: 3 vowel teams, 2 from earlier
- **Category:** Diphthongs (words 126-135) + Common Endings (words 166-175)
- **Explain diphthongs:** "These sounds SLIDE — OI slides, OW slides. Feel it in your mouth."
- **Endings:** -CK, -NG, -NK, -TCH, -DGE
- **Game:** "Minecraft Spelling" — all example words from gaming context
  - ATTACK, BLOCK, UNLOCK, MONSTER, CHALLENGE

### Day 9 (Mar 8) — "Secret Agent Letters" 🤫
**Goal:** Soft C/G, PH, silent letters — the sneaky ones
- Review: mix of 5 from any category
- **Category:** Soft C/G, PH, Silent Letters (words 186-200)
- **Explain:** "Some letters are SECRET AGENTS — they pretend to be someone else"
  - C pretends to be S (city, center)
  - G pretends to be J (giant, gentle)
  - PH pretends to be F (phone, dolphin)
  - Some letters are INVISIBLE (knee, write, knight)
- **Game:** "Spy vs Spy" — Otto finds the secret agent in each word

### Day 10 (Mar 9) — "The Influencer Challenge" 📱🎬
**Goal:** FUN review of everything — Otto is the TEACHER
- **Setup:** Otto is a YouTube/TikTok influencer teaching "spelling noobs" how to spell
- Parent films (or pretends to film) on phone
- Otto picks 15 words from the whole bank and TEACHES them:
  - "Hey guys, today I'm gonna teach you how to spell KNIGHT. So like, the K is SILENT, bro..."
  - He explains the PATTERN, then spells it
- **This is the most important day** — teaching = deepest learning
- If he's into it, let him go longer. If not, 10 words is plenty.

## 🎯 Phase 3: FINAL PREP (Days 11-12) — "Competition Mode"

### Day 11 (Mar 10) — "Mock Spelling Bee Round 1" 🏆
**Goal:** Simulate the real thing (but fun)
- **Format:** Like a real Spelling Bee:
  1. Parent says the word
  2. Otto may ask: "Can you repeat?" / "Can you use it in a sentence?" / "What does it mean?"
  3. Otto spells it out loud
  4. Parent says "Correct!" or "Good try — the word is spelled..."
- **20 words:** mix from all categories (5 easy, 10 medium, 5 challenging)
- **Rules:** No elimination! Every word counts as a point. Beat your own score.
- **Track results** — note which PATTERNS he struggles with

### Day 12 (Mar 11) — "Mock Spelling Bee FINAL + Pep Talk" 🌟
**Goal:** Confidence building, NOT cramming
- **Morning (5 min):** Quick review of ONLY the patterns he struggled with yesterday
- **Evening (10 min):** Final mock round, 15 words
- **Focus on process, not perfection:**
  1. "Listen to the word"
  2. "What pattern do you hear?"
  3. "Spell it out"
  4. "If unsure — say it slowly, listen to each sound"
- **Pep talk:** "You learned the SYSTEM. You don't need to know every word — you know how words WORK. That's your superpower."
- **End with:** His 3 favorite words. He spells them perfectly. He goes to bed confident.

## 🚨 Emergency Rules (for Mamina)

| Situation | What to do |
|-----------|------------|
| Otto refuses | "OK, no spelling today." (Come back tomorrow) |
| Otto is frustrated | Stop immediately. Hug. "You already know so much." |
| Otto says "This is boring" | Switch to a game format. Or do Influencer mode. |
| Otto gets everything right | Add 2-3 harder words. Don't say "that was easy." |
| Otto gets everything wrong | Go back to easier words. End on a win. |
| You (parent) are frustrated | STOP. Come back later. Your energy = his energy. |
| Missed a day | Skip it. Don't double up. Just continue with the next day. |
| Missed 3+ days | Compress: do Day 6 (pattern review) + Day 10 (influencer) + Day 11 (mock) |

---

*Remember: The goal is not to win. The goal is for Otto to walk into that room thinking "I know how words work." The winning takes care of itself.*
