## 🎯 The System

We're not teaching Otto to memorize 200 words. We're teaching him **9 phonics patterns** so he can spell ANY word:

1. Short Vowels (CVC)
2. Consonant Digraphs (ch, sh, th, wh)
3. Consonant Blends (bl, tr, sk...)
4. R-Controlled Vowels (Bossy R)
5. Vowel Teams (ai, ee, oa...)
6. Diphthongs (oi/oy, ou/ow)
7. Silent E (Magic E)
8. Common Endings (-ck, -ng, -tch, -dge)
9. Soft C/G, PH, Silent Letters

*Good luck, Otto! 🐝✨*
